# Implementation-of-Analog-Modulation-demodulation-scheme-using-MATLAB
Developed a user-friendly GUI following a block diagram timeline.

Enabled users to choose various modulation and demodulation processes.

Processed both real-time and recorded audio signals of reasonable duration.

Retrieved and played demodulated signals on a computer.

Made necessary assumptions for carrier frequency.

Displayed output after each block in both time and frequency domains.
